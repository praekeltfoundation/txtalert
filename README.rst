TxtAlert
========

TxtAlert is a mobile technology tool developed by Praekelt Foundation. 

It sends automated, personalized SMS reminders to patients on chronic medication. 

Apart from notifying patients of their upcoming appointments, TxtAlert also allows patients to reschedule their appointments if they are unable to attend, or if they've missed an appointment. The utilization of a "Please Call Me"- message system ensures that a patient can be in contact with the clinic / doctor to reschedule a missed appointment, even if they do not have any airtime available to call. Once a "Please Call Me"-message is received from a patient, a TxtAlert administrator will phone back the patient and assist them to confirm or reschedule an appointment.
